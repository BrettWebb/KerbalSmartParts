Parts:

* Auto-staging device that detects empty tanks, SRBs, batteries, etc.
* Timer that triggers stages and action groups after a countdown
* Remote controller that triggers actions on nearby vessels
* Altimeter device that triggers actions and stages once altitude hits configured target
* Radial fuel controllers that control fuel lines' flow
* In-line fuel controller that controls fuel flow
* A fuel valve
* Proximity sensor



------------------------------

About the pack:

Smart Parts control action groups and some other features (light, SAS). Gear control is too unreliable to be added. Most Smart Parts offer a "Select" tweakable that controls the desired action; the field above shows the selected action.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Before updating remove old Klockheed Martian Parts and, if using Space Shuttle Engines, update them.

Staging Controllers 
-------------------
The Staging Controllers must be attached to a fuel tank or SRB. The device detects when the attached fuel tank has drained and then, depending on the device, can fire an action group or stage.
Staging indicators can be made by assigning a light to an action group and automatically triggering that action group from via proper stager.
How to use the Staging Controllers (also check example crafts Firefly and Explorer)

Fuel Breakers and Controllers
-----------------------------
Controls fuel drain via action groups and a context menu. Breakers break one large fuel tank into segments that fuel lines can individually drain, far less shifting overall center of mass.

Radio Controller
----------------
Sends events to other radio controllers on a channel. All radio controllers in range (typically < 2000 m) will execute the command if the channel matches. You can also set the throttle and heading of remote vessels.

Timer
-----
Triggers a delayed staging or action group event. The staging event is executed on the vessel to which the timer is attached, therefore able to trigger a timed action even on an inactive vessel (e.g., a separated booster).

Valve
-----
Drains any excess resources, except electricity. Attach it to the tank of a resource that you would like to drain. Provides nominal amount of thrust, useful to push external tank away from shuttle on seperation.

Altimeter
---------
Capable of detecting when the craft hits a specified altitude, and if it's ascending, descending, or either, and then firing an action group or staging. Useful for auto-jettisoning fairings on ascent, or activating parachutes on landing.

Proximity Detector
------------------
Monitors other proximity detectors that are configured on the same 'channel' (20 total) and can fire actions on local and remote craft. As with altimeter, it is capable of firing on approach, departure, or both. Capable of automatic reset.
